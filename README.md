## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://codeenthusiast09.github.io/Age-Calculator/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```html
<input type="text" name="day" id="day-input" />
```

```css
/*By default, some browsers will add a blue outline around the input when it gets focus (clicked on). You can remove this behavior by adding outline: none; to the input.*/
input {
  outline: none;
}
```

```js
/* I learnt how to use javascript date to calculate age in years, months and days  and I also learnt form validation with javascript i.e: to be able to use javascript to detect errors after dates have been entered and also if no values are entered at all and if the wrong date is entered */
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
